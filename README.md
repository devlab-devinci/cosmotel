## Mix / Webpack usage
Please edit all of the assets in the `/ressources` folder (never in `/public`)
Webpack compiles the `/ressources` scss & js assets and exports them in `/public/css` or `/public/js`.

Please run :
`npm run dev OR watch` while in dev mode to enable compiling on the fly
`npm run production` to generate production ready assets' files.
